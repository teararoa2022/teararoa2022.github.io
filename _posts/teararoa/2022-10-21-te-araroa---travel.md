Let's start this crazy adventure! After 
some emotional goodbyes in Europe, 
we had to take three long flights crossing the world. First a 12-hour long Milan-Singapore, 
then a 5-hour long Singapore-Perth, and finally a 6-hour long 
Perth-Auckland!

The first flight was very long and tiring, as we almost did 
not manage to sleep at all. We therefore did not enjoy 
the little break at Singapore so much... we tried to sleep a 
little at the airport, but without much success. Especially 
because we received a message saying that our airBnB in 
Auckland got cancelled... the adventure was really beginning ðŸ˜…

Fortunately, we quickly found a not-too-expensive alternative 
in a youth hostel! We could then be more relaxed for the 
two remaining flights to go...!

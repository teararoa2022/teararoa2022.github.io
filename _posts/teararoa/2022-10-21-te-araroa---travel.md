Let's start this crazy adventure! After 
some emotional goodbyes in Europe, 
we had to take three long flights crossing the world, starting on October 18th and arriving on October 20th! 
First a 12-hour long Milan-Singapore, 
then a 5-hour long Singapore-Perth, and finally a 6-hour long 
Perth-Auckland!

The first flight was very long and tiring, as we almost did 
not manage to sleep at all. We therefore did not enjoy 
the little break at Singapore so much... we tried to sleep a 
little at the airport, but without much success. Especially 
because we received a message saying that our airBnB in 
Auckland got cancelled... the adventure was really beginning ðŸ˜…

Fortunately, we quickly found a not-too-expensive alternative 
in a youth hostel in the center. We could then be more relaxed for the 
two remaining flights to go, and we even managed to sleep relatively well...!

Around 6am, New Zealand time, we finally arrived! 
We had to pass many controls at the border, in particular 
a biocontrol in which they fully opened up our tents to check for any biological 
residuals from abroad which could bring some forest disease, 
and the standard border control for the visas. Strangely, Stefano 
got temporarily blocked at the border because it seemed that both 
of us got registered as French citizen, which was obviously incompatible with his italian passport. 
But everyone was very nice and the situation quickly resolved. 
At the airport, we were also able to buy two local SIM cards for good prices, 
and then we were finally free to explore this new city, Auckland! ... and to get a real rest!

After finding and checking in the (very minimal) hostel where we would stay for three days, 
we got a 2-hour sleep, and then we went outside to try not to be too 
jetlagged (which was not an easy task). We toured the center of Auckland by feet (we need to 
get used to walking again!), which is a very modern American-style city, with many skyscrapers,
a large commercial center, almost exclusively composed of modern buildings.

However, we discovered how strong are the Maori roots of New Zealand, even if 
we know that it has definitely not always been this obvious. Every sign and every announcement is translated in the 
two languages; we find this culture mix very interesting, and we are definitely looking 
forward to learning more about it.

In the city, we also really felt the Asian/Oriental influence. 
First because most of the restaurants are Chinese, Indian, Thai, etc, 
but also because in the parks, we found some features we would imagine 
in Japan for instance (even if we have never been there): an alley of cherries 
ready to blossom, a garden with a little red bridge, and somehow also the vegetation.

Anyway, what will remain above all, is the kindness of people here. Everyone seems 
relaxed, they have always been very helpful and very nice with us. 
But enough exploring, we need to do some last minute 
gear and grocery shopping, and get ready for the long hike to come...!

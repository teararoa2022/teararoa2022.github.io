Because of Ondine's work, we moved to Vienna in Austria for close to a year, between April 2023 and February 2024. Even though Vienna is not the austrian city which is the closest to the mountains, we still managed to have some beautiful adventures in the austrian Alps. In this page, you can find some of them (and one in a neighboring country, Slovakia)!

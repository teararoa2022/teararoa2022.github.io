To hike around its Majesty the Mont Blanc on this 
very famous tour, we decided to begin in 
Les Houches, close to Chamonix in France, and to 
turn counter-clockwise. This tour passes through 
our three home countries: France, Italy and Switzerland. 
Ah home!... üòç

{% leaflet_map {"zoom" : 10,
                "center": [45.8414835, 6.878885000000001],
                "divId" : "map_size" } %}
    {% leaflet_geojson "/assets/tmb/tmb.geojson" %}
{% endleaflet_map %}

While we had planned a 10-day hike, we unfortunately had to 
abruptly stop after 6 days in La Fouly, Switzerland, because of violent stomach issues... but 
we will surely go back to complete the tour!

We were still able to hike slightly more 
than 100km (out of 170km) with 6400m of elevation gain 
(out of 10000m). The extreme beauty of the Mont Blanc 
massif from the Italian side definitely took 
our breaths away...!

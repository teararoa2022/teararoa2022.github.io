We are Ondine and Stefano, a Swiss-French-Italian couple whose real love is hiking!

After many years of hiking in our beloved mountains close to home, our dream has finally come true: we are thru-hiking Te Araroa, a 3000km long hike crossing the whole country of New Zealand!

Starting in Cape Reinga, the northernmost point of the North Island, we are going to try to hike all the way down to Bluff, the southernmost point of the South Island.

We let you here follow our steps...! Enjoy! (Because we will ðŸ˜œ)

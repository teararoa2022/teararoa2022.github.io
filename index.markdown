Welcome to Ondine and Stefano's hiking website!

![](/assets/index0.jpg)

Since we currently live in Switzerland, most of our recent hikes take place in this gorgeous country, and you can find out about them [here]({% link switzerland.md %})! Instead, [here]({% link teararoa.md %}), you can follow the steps we took in 2022-2023 during our long-dreamed through-hike across New Zealand: Te Araroa. 

Right after spending some of the most beautiful months of our lives in New Zealand, we moved to Vienna, in Austria. Even though Vienna is not the austrian city which is the closest to the mountains, we still managed to have some beautiful adventures in the austrian Alps, documented [here]({% link austria.md %}). On August 24th, 2024, we then started the biggest of our adventures: we got married! To find out about our honeymoon, you can have a look [here]({% link reunion.md %})!

If you are interested in some other multi-day hikes that we did, you can find [here]({% link altavia9.md %}) some posts about the Alta Via 9 that we hiked in summer 2021 in the Dolomites, Italy, and you can find [here]({% link tmb.md %}) some posts about the partial Tour du Mont Blanc hike that we did in summer 2022.

Welcome to Ondine and Stefano's hiking website!

After many years of hiking in our beloved mountains close to home, our dream has finally come true: we are thru-hiking Te Araroa, a 3000km long hike crossing the whole country of New Zealand!

Starting in Cape Reinga, the northernmost point of the North Island, we are going to try to hike all the way down to Bluff, the southernmost point of the South Island.

We let you [here]({% link teararoa.md %}) follow our steps...! Enjoy! (Because we will ðŸ˜œ)


If you are interested in the other long hikes we did, you can find [here]({% link altavia9.md %}) some posts about the Alta Via 9 that we hiked in summer 2021 in the Dolomites, Italy, and you can find [here]({% link tmb.md %}) some posts about our partial Tour du Mont Blanc hike that we did in summer 2022.

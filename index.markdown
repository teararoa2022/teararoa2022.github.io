Welcome to Ondine and Stefano's hiking website!

After many years of hiking in our beloved mountains close to home, our dream has finally come true: we are tempting a thru-hike of Te Araroa, a 3000km long hike crossing the whole country of New Zealand!

Starting in Cape Reinga, the northernmost point of the North Island, we are planning to hike all the way down to Bluff, the southernmost point of the South Island.

If you are interested in some other multi-day hikes that we did, you can find [here]({% link altavia9.md %}) some posts about the Alta Via 9 that we hiked in summer 2021 in the Dolomites, Italy, and you can find [here]({% link tmb.md %}) some posts about the partial Tour du Mont Blanc hike that we did in summer 2022.

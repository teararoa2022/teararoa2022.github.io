Starting in the heights of Bolzano in Italy, this gorgeous hike brought us almost all the way to the Austrian border, while passing through the 3152m high peak Piz BoÃ¨, the panoramic piccolo Lagazuoi, the world class ski resort Cortina d'Ampezzo, the via ferrata "sentiero Bonacossa", part of the tour of the famous Tre Cime di Lavaredo, and so much more!

This hike, around 130km long and with around 8500m of elevation gain, took us 11 days to complete, including one day of rest in Cortina. We had the chance to hike the first 5 days until the piccolo Lagazuoi with 4 amazing friends. Thank you Ali, AndrÃ©, Leo e Lucia, from the bottom of our hearts! That being said, we still need to determine who is Joey and who is Chandler... ðŸ˜œ!
